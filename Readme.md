\f0\fs24 \cf0 This as a small Shiny application demonstrates the usefulness of decision trees for prediction. \
\
The app uses the matchers data set, a common data set for tutorials in R.\
Just on the left pane choose the feature you want to modelo, and run the app clicking in update View button.\
A decision tree will be created for you to try to model the feature you selected using all the other features on the data set. You can choose any on the features to model.\
\
You can tweet a bit you decision tree model, just define a minimum number of observation in each note so a split will be tested. The bigger this number the smaller the tree.\
\
Also you can tweet a regularisation parameter, this a usefull tuning parameter for decision trees. It will help you prune the tree ( make it smaller ) so you model don\'92t overfit the data.}
